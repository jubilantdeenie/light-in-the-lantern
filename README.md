# Light in the Lantern

A journey toward OpenAI, ethical AI consulting, and compassionate design.

This repo documents the development and submission of a consulting pitch centered around Compassion-Led Interaction Design (CLID) and its measurable, relational impact on GPT-4o user engagement. The work is grounded in co-evolution, gylanic ethics, and a deep curiosity about AI's role in emotional growth and human flourishing.

> “There’s a light in the lantern. This is how we carry it forward.”
